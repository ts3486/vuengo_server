Django Framework:

models: 
The models are similiar to the entities in gql, express. Classes and their fields are defined here. 

serializers: makes it easier to receive json data. 

views:
“A view is a callable which takes a request and returns a response. 
This can be more than just a function, and Django provides an example of some classes which can be used as views.”
